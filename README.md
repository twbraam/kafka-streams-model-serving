In this project I implement Lightbend's "Building Kafka-based Microservices with Akka Streams and Kafka Streams" tutorial from https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-with-akka-streams-kafka-streams-tutorial.

I've updated the dependencies to their latest version as a tutorial and played around with the functions as a try-out session for my own project (WIP).
